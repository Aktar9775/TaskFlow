<br>Developed a SaaS-based project & task management system with Kanban workflow (TODO / In Progress / Done) and user-friendly dashboard experience.

Implemented secure authentication using JWT access & refresh tokens, protected routes, and persistent login sessions.

Built complete Projects & Tasks CRUD modules with validation, error handling, and responsive UI for smooth user experience.

Integrated GitHub account linking to dynamically fetch repositories, README content, and technology stack data without saving GitHub data into database.

Designed a modern Admin Dashboard UI using Tailwind CSS including performance metrics (completion rate, task breakdown), recent projects and analytics summary.

Used Redux Toolkit + Async Thunks to manage global state, API calls, loading states, caching and error handling efficiently.

Followed SDLC practices such as modular architecture, reusable components, clean folder structure, and scalable API integration.
